# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Urban cities had the highest total weekly fare every week, suburban had the second highest, and rural had the lowest. This makes sense as urban cities tend to have higher populations than those of suburban and rural cities. Even when a rural city has a bigger population than an urban city, I can imagine the demand for ridesharing services isn't as high in the rural area as there are generally less restaurants, movie theaters, bars, etc.

## Results
Rural cities had 125 total rides, suburban had 625, and urban had 1,625. The average price per ride for rural cities was $34.62 compared to $24.53 for urban cities. This is interesting. The average price a ride in rural cities could be this high because the demand is low and/or because buildings in rural areas are more spaced out than they are in urban cities so the ride travels farther. At first glance, seeing that rural cities from this data have 78 drivers versus 2,405 for urban cities would make you think that the the average fare price is what it is mainly because of low demand. However, maybe there are only 78 drivers because of the population. It would be interesting to see how population and average distance between buildings come into play here.
