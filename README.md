# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Urban cities had the highest total weekly fare every week, suburban had the second highest, and rural had the lowest. At first this seems like this almost always be the case since urban cities tend to have higher populations than those of suburban and rural cities and even when a rural city has a bigger population than an urban city, the demand for ridesharing services probably isn't as high in the rural area as there are generally less restaurants, movie theaters, bars, etc. Let's think about this further to see make sure we're taking into account the full scope of the situation.

## Results

Rural cities had 125 total rides, suburban had 625, and urban had 1,625. The average price per ride for rural cities was $34.62 compared to $24.53 for urban cities. This is interesting. The average price a ride in rural cities could be this high because the demand is low and/or because buildings in rural areas are more spaced out than they are in urban cities so the ride travels farther. At first glance, seeing that rural cities from this data have 78 drivers versus 2,405 for urban cities would make you think that the the average fare price is what it is mainly because of low demand. However, maybe there are only 78 drivers because of the population. It would be interesting to see how population and average distance between buildings come into play here.

## Summary

I'm going to focus on strategies to get rural cities' numbers closer to those of urban cities because I think these same strategies can be implemented in suburban cities to get their numbers closer to those of urban cities. For the disparity between the number of drivers for rural and urban cities, the CEO could increase the pay in hope of gaining more drivers and in turn more customers. The same can be said about the average fare price. If the fare price goes down in the rural cities, more people might use the service. A third thing that the CEO could do is increase advertising in rural cities.
